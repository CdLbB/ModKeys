ModKeys
=======

ModKeys is software key panel which includes the modifier keys, a few commonly used keystrokes and a few buttons to perform common operations. It is intended for use with [Modbook][] (a Mac OS based tablet).

A complaint one hears about the Modbook is its lack of a hardware keyboard make some tasks more difficult, notably its lack of hardware modifier keys (command, option, etc.) make using Photoshop and other drawing applications a pain. Wacom adds a hardware key panel, called [Express Keys][], to address this issue on their pen tablets. Alas, there are no Express Keys on a Modbook. ModKeys is a software key panel that functions a bit like Wacom's Express Keys.

Use
---

This initial version is not reprogrammable, but gets the key panel and modifier keys working right. It was surprisingly difficult to build and depends on a hack involving Quickclicks (Axiotron's virtual keyboard). In future versions, as I learn more about how OSX interacts with keyboards, I'll create a more robust solution, but this works well enough for now. Note though, it requires Quickclicks to work.

Use is straightforward:

![ModKeys panel][]

And it conveniently autohides when not in use.
